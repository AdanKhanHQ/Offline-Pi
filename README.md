# Offline π - Local Multimodal Math Solver

Offline π is a local, offline-capable AI application that helps you solve complex math problems. Just upload a screenshot of a problem, and the app will provide a step-by-step solution.

## ⚠️ Important: How This App Works

This application is a **client** (the user interface) for **Ollama**, a powerful tool that runs AI models locally on your machine.

* 🔒 **100% Offline & Private:** Your images and questions are processed entirely on your computer and are never sent to a server.
* **🖥️ Requires Ollama:** You **must** install Ollama (a separate, free application) for this app to work.
* **📦 One-Time Model Download:** The first time you run this app, it will **automatically download** the required AI models. This may take several minutes. Every launch after that will be fast.
